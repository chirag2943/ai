# AlgebrAI

An interactive web application for advanced mathematics assistance.

## Overview

AlgebrAI is a Streamlit application powered by the Groq Llama3 language model. It's designed to help users with complex mathematical concepts, particularly in differential geometry, topology, and abstract algebra.

## Setup

1. **Clone (Optional):** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install:** `pip install streamlit langchain langchain-groq`
3. **API Key:** Set the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable.  **Do not hardcode it in the script.**
4. **Run:** `streamlit run your_script_name.py`

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit app in your browser.
2. Enter your mathematical questions in the chat box.
3. Review the responses, which may include LaTeX equations and code.

## Key Features

* Advanced mathematical expertise
* Clear explanations
* LaTeX support
* Code generation (Python, Mathematica)
* Conversation history
* User-friendly interface
* Emulates human mathematician
* Visualization (if required)
* Image retrieval (if required)
* Emphasis on accuracy

## Dependencies

* Streamlit
* LangChain
* LangChain-Groq

## API Key

You need a Groq API key to use this application.  Get one from Groq and set it as an environment variable (recommended) or, for testing only, as a variable in the script.  **Never commit your API key to version control.**

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational and demonstrative purposes. While it strives for accuracy, it's essential to verify the results, especially for critical applications.  The language model's responses are based on its training data and may not always be perfect.  Use with caution.
